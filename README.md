## Introduction

This project is a Tetris game implemented in C++ using OpenGL for graphics rendering. The game is developed in the Code::Blocks IDE and demonstrates fundamental game development techniques, including rendering, user input handling, and game logic implementation.

## Features

- Classic Tetris gameplay
- Smooth graphics rendered with OpenGL
- User input for controlling Tetris blocks
- Score tracking

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need:

- Code::Blocks IDE
- OpenGL library
- C++ compiler (GCC recommended)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tetris-opengl.git
    cd tetris-opengl
    ```

2. **Open the project in Code::Blocks:**

    - Launch Code::Blocks
    - Open the `tetris.cbp` project file located in the cloned repository

3. **Set up the OpenGL library:**

    Make sure you have the OpenGL library installed and properly configured in Code::Blocks. You can follow [this guide](http://wiki.codeblocks.org/index.php/Using_OpenGL_with_Code::Blocks) for detailed instructions.
